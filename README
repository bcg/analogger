The Swiftcore Analogger implements a fast asynchronous logging system
for Ruby programs as well as client library for sending logging messages
to the Analogger process.

Analogger will accept logs from multiple sources and can have multiple
logging destinations.  Currently, logging to a file, to STDOUT, or to
STDERR is supported.  A future revision may support logging to a
database destination, as well.

Analogger depends on EventMachine (http://rubyforge.org/projects/eventmachine)
to provide the framework for the network communications, though EM is
not used for the client library.
